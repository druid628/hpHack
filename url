Well, contest is kind of a misnomer. No prizes, just amusement.

Anyway, the challenge: port l0pht's hp.c (don't worry, it's a harmless prank) to as many different programming/scripting languages as possible. Functionality must be the same. Implement as much as possible in the chosen language (eg: no shelling out to other languages to do bits). Bonus points for code elegance (now mind you, those are "Whose Line is it Anyway?" type points :).

UPDATE: If you don't have an HP printer to test on, at least check your code by firing up netcat thusly:
$ nc -l -p 9100 | hexdump -C
and then firing off your test program at localhost. This will determine whether your program is producing the proper data stream.

Here is a sample output from the real hp.c:

kjotte@reliant:~$ nc -l -p 9100 | hexdump -C & ./hp localhost "test message"
[1] 27782
HP Display hack -- sili@l0pht.com
Hostname:   localhost
Message: test message

At some point my little contest made it outside the confines of the LUG. I think I posted it in response to a blog or something. They say the mind is the last thing to go ... :)
